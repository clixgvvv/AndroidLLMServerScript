Python Script that rises a Localhost LLM server using [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) on Android.

## 📝 Technology Explanation
This script allows you to create a LLM Service using an Android device as Server.

Android `Termux` can't compile `llama-server` due to it lacks of some necessary libraries, this python script makes a workaround by using `llama-simple` instead.

## 🛠️ Setup
In your Android 13+ device (tested), install Termux and run the following commands:

```
pkg update && pkg upgrade
pkg install git cmake clang wget python
```

Then clone and install `llama.cpp` following it's guide.

Get a LLM model suitable for your device.

Then, adapt the Python Script with your folder structure and copy it to your Android device, then run:

```
python server.py
```

Then, your service would be published on your local network and will be listening at the `8000` port by default.

## ⚙️ Project Usage Explanation
In order to test the service, you can use `test.html`, the LLM's response will appear bellow the textbox.
